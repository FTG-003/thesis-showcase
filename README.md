# Cognitive Intraspecific Selection in Education

This repository hosts the web application for the academic thesis **"Cognitive Intraspecific Selection in Education: From Individualism to Collective Strength"** by Fabrizio Terzi.

This research presents an innovative transposition of biological intraspecific selection to educational contexts, reimagining how ideas compete, evolve, and strengthen collective intelligence.

## Abstract

By treating ideas as the fundamental units of selection rather than individuals, the thesis explores four critical isomorphisms:
1.  **Variazione** negli approcci educativi.
2.  **Selection** through epistemic competition.
3.  **Heritability** of successful pedagogical models.
4.  **Adaptation** to learning environments.

The framework introduces **Pyragogy**, a novel approach that integrates Cognitive Reciprocation, Ritualization of Conflict, and non-agentive AI facilitation for building collective intelligence.

Through the proposed **Educational Quality Intelligence (EQI)** metrics and the innovative **IdeoEvo** pilot project, this research offers practical pathways to transition from traditional individualistic education to collective cognitive strength.
