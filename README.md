## ðŸš€ Deployment to GitHub Pages

### Steps to Deploy:

1. **Update the base path** in `vite.config.ts`:
   - Replace `/nome-del-tuo-repository/` with your actual GitHub repository name
   - Example: If your repo is `https://github.com/username/pyragogy`, change it to `/pyragogy/`

2. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Configure GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repository Settings â†’ Pages
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose the branch containing your `dist` folder
   - Save settings

4. **Deploy**:
   - Commit and push the `dist` folder to your repository
   - Or use GitHub Actions (see below)

### Alternative: Using GitHub Actions (Recommended)

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
        
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
        
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
        with:
          path: ./dist
          
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
```
